# drizzle-orm-sqlite 0.14.1

- Separated migrations functionality to a separate import:
```typescript
import { migrate } from 'drizzle-orm-sqlite/better-sqlite3/migrate';
```
- Replaced `await new SQLiteConnector(client).connect()` with `drizzle(client)`.
- `import { SQLiteConnector } from 'drizzle-orm-sqlite` -> `import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm-pg/better-sqlite3`.
