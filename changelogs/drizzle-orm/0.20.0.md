- 🎉 **Implemented support for WITH clause ([docs](/drizzle-orm/src/pg-core/README.md#with-clause)). Example usage:**

  ```ts
  const sq = db
    .select()
    .from(users)
    .prepareWithSubquery('sq');

  const result = await db
    .with(sq)
    .select({
      id: sq.id,
      name: sq.name,
      total: sql<number>`count(${sq.id})::int`(),
    })
    .from(sq)
    .groupBy(sq.id, sq.name);
  ```

- 🐛 Fixed various bugs with selecting/joining of subqueries.
- ❗ Renamed `.subquery('alias')` to `.as('alias')`.
- ❗ ``sql`query`.as<type>()`` is now ``sql<type>`query`()``. Old syntax is still supported, but is deprecated and will be removed in one of the next releases.
