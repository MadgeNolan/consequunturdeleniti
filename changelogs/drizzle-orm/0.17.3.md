We have released [AWS Data API support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html) for PostgreSQL

---

Connection example

```typescript
import { drizzle, migrate } from 'drizzle-orm/aws-data-api/pg';

const rdsClient = new RDSDataClient({});

const db = drizzle(rdsClient, {
  database: '',
  secretArn: '',
  resourceArn: '',
});

await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: '' });
```

> **Note**:
> All drizzle pg data types are working well with data api, except of `interval`. This type is not yet mapped in proper way
